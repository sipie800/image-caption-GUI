# A simple and useful image caption app
Do you believe that high quality intelligence is made from human-AI deep interaction? Not by human himself, neither by AI itself.

The idea behind is to support human-crafted and **HIGH** quality captioning with a nice enough GUI, rather than the "automatic, fast, yet **COMMON** quality" captioning.

I did a survey and surprisingly there is no such an app there. This app is nothing special but to make a human concentrate on create fine captions in a cozy workflow.

Any AI-aiding features is bound to be added later, as long as the feature is helpful for human captioning.

## usage
0. Open a image, the rest images in the same path will be loaded.
1. Broswer your images in GUI and type in the captions in normal way. txt will be saved in the same path. (for sd-scripts...etc)
2. Optionallly, caption in a selecting way. BY writing your own **<your_image_path>_meta.json** file to define any attributes you wanna to caption. And select attribute values for each image. The attributes will be saved in json files for further processing.
3. **Ctrl+D**, copy caption. **Ctrl+F**, paste caption. **Tab**, switch the first attribute fast (in case that you may wanna do rough and fast filtering of many images).
4. Write your own **highlight.txt** in lines to highlight the words you wanna to.
5. The usages is easy to understand, see the **pepe_caption_example**.
